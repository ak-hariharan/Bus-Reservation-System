# Bus-Reservation-System
This project is done by myself with the help of Logic First Tamil YouTube channel. All rights belongs to mentor which help to study and write the code. I have done this project and updated here for my learning roadmap in java. Thanks to Logic First Tamil :)
For running this application, simply track into the "src/busResv"  you can see the three java files. BusDemo.java is the main file.
